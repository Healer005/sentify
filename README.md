# Sentify

## Overview
Sentify is a sentiment analysis project that classifies IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using a neural network built with Keras.
Leveraging the IMDB dataset, it showcases skills in natural language processing (NLP), data preprocessing, and deep learning, with an optional Flask web app for real-time predictions.

## Features
* Data Preprocessing: Loads and pads the IMDB dataset for uniform input.
* Model: Implements a neural network (Embedding + LSTM) for binary classification.
* Evaluation: Measures accuracy and loss on test data.
* Opional Enhancements: Includes data visualization (e.g., training plots) and a Flask-based deployment. (Future milestones)

## Tech Stack
* Python: Core programming language.
* TensorFlow/Keras: For dataset access and model building.
* Flask: Optional web app deployment.
* Matplotlib: Visualization of results.

## Future Improvements
* Add support for transformer models (e.g., BERT).
* Enhance the web app with a better UI.
